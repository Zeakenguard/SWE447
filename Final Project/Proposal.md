Final Project Proposal

For my final project for Graphics Programming, I want to create a 3D music visualizer using WebGL, WebAudio API, and possibly Three.js. My project will take an audio file as input and, in realtime, visualize the waveform for the file with different color shapes and lines. I want the visualizer to simply render the waveform as an animated 2D line that changes color, however my stretch goal will be to allow the player to change the shape of the visualization.

Development Plan

Week 1: Reaserch and learn the WebAudio API, learn about audio waveform and audio frequency data analysis.

Week 2: Create a prototype web application that accepts and plays audio files.

Week 3: Implement rendering graphics in web applicaiton window.

Week 4: Implement waveform visualization using animated graphics.

Week 5: (stretch goal) Implement options to change shape of visualizer graphic object. (Circle, square, sphere, or cube.)
